# Clinical applicability of deep learning-based respiratory signal prediction models for four-dimensional radiation therapy


We compared respiration predictions using three deep learning models. <br/> 
We share the deep learning model and example data used for respiration prediction. <br/> 
Respiratory prediction using deep learning compensates for the latency time of the radiation therapy device, and it seems that it can be used in clinical practice. <br/>
