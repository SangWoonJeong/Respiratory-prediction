# Clinical applicability of deep learning-based respiratory signal prediction models for four-dimensional radiation therapy


## Introduction
In radiation therapy, the respiratory gating method is widely used to account for the patient's breathing during treatment. However, this method introduces delays between beam on and off times. These delays can reduce the accuracy of the treatment and potentially harm normal tissues, making delay compensation necessary.

We utilize artificial intelligence methods to predict breathing patterns under various delay conditions. The models used in our research are LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and Transformer, with delay times of 300, 500, and 700 ms
